# VRC-Connect4

## Overview
This is a VRC version of the traditional board game, Connect-4. It works almost identical to the real game! Two players can join via the UI menu panel included with the board game, press start, and you play it just how you would play regular Connect-4! Not much to say about that. 

I am currently planning to update this at some point with scorekeeping but seeing as it will take quite a bit of coding work, this may take a while.

This is being made free to use by the community and you may alter and improve the package as you wish. All I ask is that, if you alter the package and wish to distribute it, that you do so freely. There is no need to credit me or the other people listed below, you may do so if you wish however. What I would appreciate is if you leave the link to this package on the UI panel so that other people know where it was downloaded.


## Acknowledgements
The Connect-4 board model is by [D3PO on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4702969)


## Dependencies
It is VERY important that you have [Udonsharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp) downloaded already before downloading this package! The Connect-4 package won't work without it!


## Set-Up
Simply import the Unity package into your Unity project, navigate to the Connect-4 folder, select the Connect-4 prefab and drag and drop the prefab into the scene! Simple as that!

Please note that the game chips are pickup objects with gravity enabled. This means that you must put the game on a solid surface (one with colliders), else, the game chips will just fall through the surface you placed the game on.
